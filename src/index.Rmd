# Objective

The objective of this analysis is to describe the site conditions for the purpose of planning forest management activities at the Colorado State Forest ([CSF](https://csfs.colostate.edu/colorado-state-forest/)) site for the Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change ([ASCC](https://www.adaptivesilviculture.org/)) project. This analysis quantifies the potential direct incident radiation and temperature at the site which will be utilized for planning the spatial arrangement of forest management treatments.
